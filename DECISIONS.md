# Decisions

Where SPEC.md left room, this is the reading chosen and why. The guiding question each time: what best serves the reviewer owning his code again.

## Claude CLI is hardened beyond the spec's flags

The spec's call is kept as it is, plus four flags:
`--restricted --tools "Read,Grep,Glob" --strict-mcp-config --no-session-persistence`.

- `--restricted` ignores user, project and local settings files. Without it, a PR could ship its own `.claude/settings.json` with hooks or allow rules, and hooks run shell commands: PR code would run on the reviewer's machine. It also keeps the file tools inside the worktree (and the context folder added with `--add-dir`).
- `--tools "Read,Grep,Glob"` removes every other built-in tool, so nothing depends on the deny list being complete.
- `--strict-mcp-config` loads no MCP servers (the reviewer's MCP servers include ones that run code).
- `--no-session-persistence` keeps review runs out of the reviewer's Claude session history.
- `--bare` was tried and not used: it does not read the subscription login, so every run failed.
